# vue-markdown-portfolio

## About
```
This project is a POC using Vue and Marked to set up a generalized portfolio site that a non programmer can simply add new markdown files to and it will simply appear on their list of projects. Just add a new element to projects.js, and a new folder under "posts" that is the same name with a .md and a .png file, and the
application will find and load it automatically.
```

## TODO
```
-Started to add side bars to break up text from the images, but it is not complete.
-The styling is very rough all around
-It would be good to make the post loadings a bit more flexible.
